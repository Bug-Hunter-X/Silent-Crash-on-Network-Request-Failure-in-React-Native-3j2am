# Silent Crash on Network Request Failure in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where a network request failure leads to a silent crash.  The issue stems from improper error handling within an asynchronous operation, resulting in an unhandled promise rejection.

## Problem

The provided `MyComponent` attempts to fetch data from an API.  While a `try...catch` block is included to handle errors, the application silently crashes if the network request fails.  This lack of user feedback makes debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all promises are handled, even in the `finally` block and improving error reporting. This change enhances the user experience and makes debugging much simpler.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or device.
4. Observe the crash behavior when simulating a network failure (e.g., by turning off internet connection).
